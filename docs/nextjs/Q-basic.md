## getStaticProps

Nextjs has a threshold 128kB in a page. So we can not send data over the threshold.

### When i find out that quition

I want to use image in a static server. If we want to do that, we need to transfer image blob to base64. However, when i add base64 picture links, the post web will be abnormal and can not show all pictures. Even the image element is no src atrribute. Oh my god!!! That's means i have to go back to use the public static directory.
