Why? Today, I am building a website for the friend in HK, and have lived in CN. Last week, I can access the github.io domain. Sadly, now, i cannot do it again. As my suppose, the new year is a symbol of CN, to enforce the power of China. They try to control and limit human ideas with GFS. I dont't think github.io is a bad thing for us and CN. But, recently, the government has released a post about network control. And i have understood what they want to do it. So, now, have to use some tech toolkit to access them. I am sad, this is CN? Y. As a Chinese, that means i have to accept their effect. As a human, we should say no to these. This ignore personal development and beef the power in Govenment. If the most of government serve for people, that maybe a great thing. However, what things are they want, that is use people money to complete personal things. It's the best choices? no. So, i am feel sorry to the government. But, i still want to believe they will do it in the future. Now, i feel sad and extremely hate it.
