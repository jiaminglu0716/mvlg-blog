Today,I learn about the book of confession who want to express ideas to her.Someone tell me if you want to appeal to girl,knowledge is important which about girl's hobby,think quickly and make a humorous atmosphere to talk with each other. 

After lunch,I talk something about yingtong's annoying things and face office asistant.I know if i can talk with her,i need to talk with more girls using different ways.

Afternoon,I participate to photography meeting so as to promote my abilities.But it only tell us iso  what it is.It is too broad.And we go to our field to bring some paper about volunteer activities and wear a cloth to prove our identification.The poccess is difficult.Although i can't do it,i insist on deliver this paper to everyone.make more persons know this activity.I can see xinru and know more things,which make me happy.Next activity is apartment meeting in the third floor of LiangQiuJuTang.Unbelievable things have happened in it.For example:1.If I want to sit on this chair which has a board will down.it make me upset and uncomfortable.China has a story about a man who lose his one leg feel sad,but he can¡¯t be forced to join in army.So,it tell us that we need to have optimistic attitude.Sometimes good things are not always best,they may be bad things.we need to use another views to see problems.At this meeting,I have to try my best to pick up my hand to share my experiences about promotional activity which give me power and friendship.I can¡¯t speak smoothly like my friend zhengwei,but I have a heart to tell my story with each other.when I finish my dialog,volunteer member applaud.It¡¯s too warm,just like a friend.I hope this relation can last forever.
